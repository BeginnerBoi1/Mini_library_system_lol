What does it do 
- It just simulates a simple library where a user gets to choose books and once they're done, they get a receipt
  
Why did I made this
- I'm still trying to figure out oop and creating small projects like this somewhat improves my understanding of the concept

Limitations of the program:
  1. Messy code
  2. Limited options (There's literally only two options in the program)
  3. Not interactive
  4. Operated in a terminal

Special note from the creator
- Type -1 during the selection of books to escape the loop and proceed with the display of receipt
- Don't forget to download the list.txt file
